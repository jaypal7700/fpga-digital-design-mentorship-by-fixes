# fpga-digital-design-mentorship-by-fixes
Welcome to the *Digital Core: FPGA & RTL Design Mentorship Program*! This repository contains learning modules, project files, and resources for mentees participating in the program. The goal is to provide hands-on experience with digital system design using Verilog/SystemVerilog and FPGA platforms.

## 🚀 Program Goals
- Learn and apply RTL design fundamentals
- Simulate and debug digital circuits
- Synthesize and deploy designs on FPGA hardware
- Understand real-world timing, constraints, and tool flows
- Build a final FPGA project and document your work

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Verilog / SystemVerilog
- FPGA Tools: Xilinx Vivado / Intel Quartus
- Simulation: ModelSim / GHDL / Icarus Verilog
- Platforms: PYNQ, Basys 3, Nexys A7 (or simulation-only if hardware unavailable)
- Git, GitHub, Markdown

## 📁 Repository Structure

## 🧠 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository  
2. Go to any module inside /modules and follow the instructions  
3. Simulate → Debug → Synthesize → Implement → Deploy (if hardware is available)  
4. Document your learnings in markdown or PDF  

## 📫 Contributions
Mentees should fork this repository and submit PRs to share progress. Include testbenches and waveform screenshots for verification.
